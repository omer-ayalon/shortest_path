### Find The Shortest Path ###

There are searching algorithms for finding the shortest path in a graph. I did three algorithms, BFS, Dijkstra and A*.

All algorithms find the path from corner up left of the screen, to bottom right. In can draw obstacles in BFS and A* by
left click, and right click to remove them. Press Enter To Start The Algorithm.
